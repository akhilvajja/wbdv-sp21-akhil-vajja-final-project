# Mini Services

People need help however small the work may be. Professionals charge amount for a minimum of hour even when the work done is around 30 minutes. Works like packing or unpacking stuff into boxes, moving big items like a new sofa into house, Need of house help for a couple of hours cost lots of amount.
There are two types of users in this application. Helpers and Customers.
Customers request for help in the category of service they need and helper can provide estimated cost for that specific work. Once customer accepts the amount, the helper can go to the detination and help the customer. The amount would be prorated to the minutes worked.

Helper goals: 
  1) Able to register, login and create a profile as helper.
  2) Check for user requests and provide estimated cost for an hour.

Customer goals:
  1) Able to register, login and create a profile as customer.
  2) post requests for the work that needs to be done.
  3) Based on the provided estimated costs by the helpers, choose one of them.

My goal is to bring the amount down reasonably by prorating and charging the amount based on minutes worked so that users can afford the services.

I'd be using the google maps javascript API as the locations will be sharing their address and helpers can reach their destination once customer accepts the helper.
